This repository contains three different machine learning projects:

1.Titanic Survival Prediction
2.Movie Rating Prediction
3.Iris Flower Classification

Introduction
This repository showcases different machine learning techniques and models applied to various datasets. The goal of each project is to provide insights and practical examples of predictive modeling.


## Titanic Survival Prediction

### Description
The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves predicting whether passengers survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset available from Kaggle.

### Key Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

### Files
titanic_survival_prediction.py: Main script for model training and evaluation.
titanic_data.csv: Dataset used for training and testing.


## Movie Rating Prediction

### Description
The Movie Rating Prediction project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on features such as movie genre, director, and cast. This project uses collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques.

### Key Features
Data exploration and preprocessing
Implementation of collaborative filtering models
Evaluation using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### Files
movie_rating_prediction.py: Main script for model training and evaluation.
movie_ratings_data.csv: Dataset used for training and testing.


## Iris Flower Classification

### Description
The Iris Flower Classification project involves classifying Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements. The project uses the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for introductory classification tasks.

### Key Features
Data loading and exploration
Model training using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and other classifiers
Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification report
